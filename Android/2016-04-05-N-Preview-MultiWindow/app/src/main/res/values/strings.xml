    <string name="multi_window_message">Android N adds support for displaying more than one app at the same time.
        On handheld devices, two apps can run side-by-side or one-above-the-other in split-screen mode.
        On TV devices, apps can use picture-in-picture mode to continue video playback while users are interacting
        with another app.
        \n\n
        If you build your app with the N Preview SDK, you can configure how your app handles
        multi-window display. For example, you can specify your activity\'s minimum allowable dimensions.
        You can also disable multi-window display for your app, ensuring that the system only shows your app in full-screen mode.</string>
